# An Android Start Trek Alliance Helper App

<p>I was gifted a copy of Fantasy Flight's Star Trek Alliance board game.  Though I enjoy the game, doing all the tasks 
can become a chore.  As I need to learn more coding, I started working on a Java app helper.  It is on my github as well.</
<p>For now, it is just a text outline that will soon be complete enough to use to play the game.  As time goes on, I will automate things such as dice throws and damage accounting.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress and you must use it at your own risk.  The APK is included at various update stages.  APK apps can damage phones if you aren't careful, so use at your own risk.  However, this app is running on my Motorola without problem.</p>

## Update 04/25/2022

<p>Arbitrarily enforced some structure on the app source.  Probably in future, I'll use an index.js that calls App.js from /src, but for now, I'll stick with this form.

<p>This app will be a carbon copy of the game rules, just organized where you can get around.  Will probably add some dice throw components, but may not take this version much further.  When this is app is done, then I'll do it more like the Java version I started, fully automated.
